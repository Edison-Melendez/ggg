The Advanced Control Systems Lab (ACSL) Flight Stack - Winged is a PX4-compatible offboard software designed for **Copter** UAVs (uncrewed aerial vehicles). This software aims to provide the UAV control community with an open-source, freeware solution that acts as a common platform, enabling easier comparison of research outcomes.

### We strongly encourage control practitioners, researchers, and UAV enthusiasts to:
- Use this code
- Improve it
- Provide constructive feedback
- Propose edits through [GitHub](https://github.com/andrealaffly/ACSL-flightstack?tab=readme-ov-file)

At the moment, this code is designed for quad-biplanes (QRBPs), which are quadcopters with two parallel wings. This architecture currently supports up to 8 motors and, in the future, will be improved to support additional classes of fixed-wing aircraft.

The Advanced Control Systems Lab (ACSL) Flight Stack is a PX4-compatible offboard flight stack designed for **multi-rotor** UAVs (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles). This open-source, freeware software serves as a shared platform for the UAV control community, enabling easier comparison and evaluation of research outcomes.

This flight stack is tailored for autonomous UAVs featuring collinear propellers, such as quadcopters, X8-copters, and hexacopters. It currently supports both quadcopters and X8-copters. With adjustments, the software can be adapted to other UAV configurations that utilize similar propeller arrangements.
